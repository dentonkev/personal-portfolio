# Personal Portfolio Website

I built this portfolio as an extension of my resume to showcase by web desigining and technical skills. This portfolio was also built as an application to [devsoc](https://devsoc.app/) trainees program for 2024. 

It contains a landing page, about section, project section, skills section and a contact section that was built entirely with html and css.
